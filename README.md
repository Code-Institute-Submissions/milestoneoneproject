### Structure Plane
see link to document
[Structure Plane](./user-design-experience/Structure_Plane/Structure_Plane.pdf)

    Information Architecture
    Will be a simple tree structure using a horizontal bar near the top of the page taking up the right two
    thirds of the page.
    Interaction Design (IXD)
    • Site Logo will bring user back to home as well as having ‘Home’ on the navigation bar in case
    some un-tech savvy users don’t know this convention.
    • Each Menu heading will have some sort of roll over to confirm that clicking that area has an
    action.
    • Each navigation button will have a particular color, which will be used on its corresponding page
    to visually confirm what page they are on.
    o On mobile device the hamburger icon will be used.
    • The ‘Special offer for training and free first assessment ’ information will be at the top of each
    page.
    o It will bring up a pop-up with a simple form that asks for their first name and last name
    and email address.
    o A radio button to choose what it will be eg training , development , consulting.
    o We will include that their email won’t be passed on to anyone else.
    o We will provide a message once they have successfully completed the form and hit the
    submit button.
    • The social links to Facebook, LinkedIn will have roll-over effects and open in a blank window.
    • On the landing page section there will be 5 block with a short description and if you click on it
    will take you to either to the product, service or training page
    • In the footer there will be links to about and Contact and Privacy statement, this will be on all
    the pages
    
    **see document for diagram:*
[Structure Plane](./user-design-experience/Structure_Plane/Structure_Plane.pdf)
    
**Note that the  final product there was some changes as the customer was not thet focused on teh privacy statement as it s still working on that also they did not need to to see the need for a pop up on each page.  Als they did not want different color per page as it is not seemed fit for a prefesional company (and was looking more for background pictures to fit IOT and AI (arifical networks).They also wanted an ectra selection on the form as they need to know which field of technology the cusomer was intrested in.   They wanted the sosial media logo as they are going to us it in the future*


### Skeleton Plane

#### mockups:

In the links below you can see the mockups that I drew using the mockup tool “Balsamiq”:
![Desk top mockup](./user-design-experience/Skeleton_Plane/Desk_Top_Mockup.jpg)
![Mobile mockup](./user-design-experience/Skeleton_Plane/Mobile_mockup.jpg)
- 
**Note that the final design has changed from the original design in the mockups. The reason why it has changed is because I was trying different layouts while I was experimenting and learning the code and sometimes the new designs looked better than the original ones or was just more responsive. In the desktop design the block with information was not that dominant which I have changed it the and made bigger and put is on the background picture with a carousel.   Als have I centered the Main information block and added a madal with a button.  On the mobile design I have added no picture and have just made use of the info block and made sure the button was visable for the user.  I have also replaced the logo at the footer and put the links for contact and sosial media*
